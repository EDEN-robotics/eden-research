### After Adding Content
1. **Update relevant reading lists**: If you added a new resource
2. **Cross-reference**: Link to related content in other folders
3. **Notify team**: Share relevant additions with team members
4. **Follow up**: Update content as research progresses

## üìû Getting Help

- **Questions about content**: Ask in team channels
- **Technical issues**: Check existing documentation first
