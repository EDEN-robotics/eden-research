## Overview
This document outlines the research approach for Eden's autonomous navigation system, focusing on path planning and obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments.

## Objectives
- Develop robust path planning algorithms for indoor/outdoor navigation
- Implement real-time obstacle detection and avoidance
- Create adaptive behavior system for different environmental conditions
- Ensure safety and reliability in human-occupied spaces

## Research Questions
1. What path planning algorithms work best for mobile robots in mixed environments?
2. How can we balance computational efficiency with navigation accuracy?
3. What sensor fusion techniques provide the most reliable obstacle detection?
4. How should the system adapt to different lighting and weather conditions?

## Methodology
1. **Literature Review**: Survey existing navigation algorithms and approaches
2. **Simulation Testing**: Use Gazebo/ROS for algorithm validation
3. **Prototype Development**: Build scaled-down test platform
4. **Field Testing**: Validate in real-world environments
5. **Iteration**: Refine based on test results
