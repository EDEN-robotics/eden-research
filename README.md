# Eden Research Repository

Welcome to the Eden Research Repository - the central knowledge base and research hub for the Eden robotics + AI project.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a collaborative research workspace where each subsystem team can:
- Collect and organize research resources
- Document findings and insights
- Build structured outlines for future work
- Share knowledge across teams

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For New Contributors

1. **Start with the master outline**: Read [RESEARCH_OUTLINE.md](RESEARCH_OUTLINE.md) for the complete research roadmap
2. **Choose your subsystem**: Navigate to the appropriate folder (`software/`, `hardware/`, or `general/`)
3. **Read existing research**: Check the `reading-list.md` and browse `notes/` and `outlines/` folders
4. **Add your research**: Follow the guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md`

### Example Workflow

When you find a useful resource:

1. **Add to reading list**: Update the relevant `reading-list.md` with a brief description
2. **Create a note**: Add a detailed summary in the `notes/` folder
3. **Update outlines**: If it impacts project planning, update relevant files in `outlines/`

## 📝 Folder Guidelines

### `reading-list.md`
- Curated collection of links to papers, documentation, videos, and tools
- Organized by category (Papers, Documentation, Videos, etc.)
- Include brief descriptions and relevance notes
- Keep entries concise but informative

### `notes/`
- Freeform markdown notes from meetings, personal research, or experiments
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `2024-01-15-robotics-meeting.md`)
- Include dates, participants, and key takeaways
- Feel free to be informal and exploratory

### `outlines/`
- Structured documents that summarize research findings
- Project plans, technical specifications, and research roadmaps
- Use clear headings and organized sections
- Focus on actionable insights and next steps

## 🤝 Contributing

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines on:
- How to add new research resources
- File naming conventions
- Markdown formatting standards
- Review and approval processes

## 📋 Quick Reference

- **Found a paper?** → Add to `reading-list.md` + create summary in `notes/`
- **Had a meeting?** → Document key points in `notes/`
- **Planning research?** → Create structured outline in `outlines/`
- **Questions?** → Check existing research first, then ask in team channels
